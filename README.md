# LucidLonghorns
NFT smart contract for Texas Blockchain @UT

To test this code for yourself, first clone the repo with

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/TexasBlockchainDAO/LucidLonghorns`

Once finished, unless already downloaded globally, you will need to download
openzeppelin's required contracts with

`npm install @openzeppelin/contracts`

From here, feel free to tweak the code to perform whatever task you want.

# Interacting with the contract

You can interact with the contract right after downloading by running the terminal command 
`sudo python3 -m http.server 80` for linux or 
`python3 -m http.server 80` for any other OS while in the `website` directory of this project 
*Note that administrator privileges are required to start a service, like a http webserver.

From here, just play around with the existing functions, add buttons, etc. 

In case you want to connect from a self-made front end, the contract address is 

| Contract                  | Address
